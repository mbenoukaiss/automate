//! A low level and asynchronous rust library made for interacting with Discord's API.
//!
//! This library provides all the tools that will handle setting up and maintaining
//! a connection to Discord's API in order to make a bot.
//! Before messing with the code of this library, you first need to get a bot token
//! on [Discord's developers portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
//! Create a new application and add a bot to the newly created application.
//! You can then copy the bot's token by clicking the copy button.
//!
//! In order to build your bot, you must first provide it with the settings you'd like to use which
//! is done using the [Configuration](automate::Configuration) struct:
//! - [Configuration::new](automate::Configuration::new): Takes the bot token as parameter. You
//! can provide a hardcoded string, take it from the environment or retrieve it from a configuration
//! file.
//! - [Configuration::from_env](automate::Configuration::from_env): Does the same as `new` except
//! it takes the bot token from the given environment variable.
//! - [Configuration::register](automate::Configuration::register): Registers stateful and
//! stateless listeners.
//! - [Configuration::enable_logging](automate::Configuration::enable_logging) and
//! [Configuration::disable_logging](automate::Configuration::disable_logging): Enable or
//! disable Automate's built in logger. You can disable it and use your own logger if necessary.
//! - [Configuration::level_for](automate::Configuration::level_for): Sets the minimum log level
//! for a line to be printed in the console output for the given module.
//! - [Configuration::intents](automate::Configuration::intents): Sets the events which will
//! be sent to the bot using [intents](automate::Intent). Defaults to all events.
//! - [Configuration::presence](automate::Configuration::presence): Sets the presence of the bot.
//!
//! The resulting configuration object can then be sent to
//! [Automate::launch](automate::Automate::launch) which will start the bot.
//!
//! # Listeners
//! Discord sends various events through their API about messages, guild and
//! user updates, etc. Automate will then relay these events to your bot through
//! the listeners you will define. There are two ways to create listeners:
//!
//! ## Stateless listeners
//! The easiest way to create a listener is to use a stateless listener. A stateless listener is
//! a simple asynchronous function with the `#[listener]` attribute. As its name says, it doesn't
//! have a state and thus can't save data across calls.
//! ```
//! # use automate::{Context, Error, listener};
//! # use automate::gateway::MessageCreateDispatch;
//! #
//! #[listener]
//! async fn print_hello(ctx: &Context, data: &MessageCreateDispatch) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     println!("Hello!");
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The function you declare must take two arguments as in the example above. The first
//! argument is the session, it provides information about the bot and all the methods
//! allowing you to send instructions to Discord through their HTTP API. The second
//! argument is the dispatch struct which contains all the data about the event you received.
//! Events and thus allowed types for the second argument are:
//! - [ReadyDispatch](automate::gateway::ReadyDispatch): called right after the connection with
//! discord is established. Provides data about current guilds, DMs and the bot user account.
//! - [ChannelCreateDispatch](automate::gateway::ChannelCreateDispatch): a channel (guild channel
//! or DM) was created.
//! - [ChannelUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::ChannelUpdateDispatch): a channel (guild channel
//! or DM) was updated.
//! - [ChannelDeleteDispatch](automate::gateway::ChannelDeleteDispatch): a channel (guild channel
//! or DM) was deleted.
//! - [ChannelPinsUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::ChannelPinsUpdateDispatch): a message was
//! pinned or unpinned.
//! - [GuildCreateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildCreateDispatch): a guild was created, became
//! available or the bot was added to a guild.
//! - [GuildUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildUpdateDispatch): a guild was updated.
//! - [GuildDeleteDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildDeleteDispatch): a guild was deleted, became
//! unavailable or the bot was removed from the guild.
//! - [GuildBanAddDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildBanAddDispatch): a user was banned from a guild.
//! - [GuildBanRemoveDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildBanRemoveDispatch): a user was unbanned
//! from a guild.
//! - [GuildEmojisUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildEmojisUpdateDispatch): the emojis of a
//! guild were updated.
//! - [GuildIntegrationsUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildIntegrationsUpdateDispatch):
//! the integration of a guild was updated.
//! - [GuildMemberAddDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildMemberAddDispatch): a user joined a guild.
//! - [GuildMemberUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildMemberUpdateDispatch): a guild member was updated.
//! - [GuildMemberRemoveDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildMemberRemoveDispatch): a user was removed from a guild.
//! - [GuildMembersChunkDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildMembersChunkDispatch): response to a
//! request guild members (not yet implemented).
//! - [GuildRoleCreateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildRoleCreateDispatch): a role was created.
//! - [GuildRoleUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildRoleUpdateDispatch): a role was updated.
//! - [GuildRoleDeleteDispatch](automate::gateway::GuildRoleDeleteDispatch): a role was deleted.
//! - [InviteCreateDispatch](automate::gateway::InviteCreateDispatch): an invite to a channel was created.
//! - [InviteDeleteDispatch](automate::gateway::InviteDeleteDispatch): an invited to a channel was deleted.
//! - [MessageCreateDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageCreateDispatch): a message was created
//! - [MessageUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageUpdateDispatch): a message updated.
//! - [MessageDeleteDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageDeleteDispatch): a message was deleted.
//! - [MessageDeleteBulkDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageDeleteBulkDispatch): multiple messages 
//! were deleted at once.
//! - [MessageReactionAddDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageReactionAddDispatch): a user reacted to a message.
//! - [MessageReactionRemoveDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageReactionRemoveDispatch): a user's
//! reaction was removed from a message.
//! - [MessageReactionRemoveAllDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageReactionRemoveAllDispatch): all
//! reactions were explicitly removed from a message.
//! - [MessageReactionRemoveEmojiDispatch](automate::gateway::MessageReactionRemoveEmojiDispatch):
//! all reactions for a given emoji were explicitly removed from a message.
//! - [PresenceUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::PresenceUpdateDispatch): user was updated.
//! - [TypingStartDispatch](automate::gateway::TypingStartDispatch): user started typing in a channel.
//! - [UserUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::UserUpdateDispatch): properties about the user changed.
//! - [VoiceStateUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::VoiceStateUpdateDispatch): a user joined, left,
//! or moved a voice channel.
//! - [VoiceServerUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::VoiceServerUpdateDispatch): guild's voice
//! server was updated.
//! - [WebhooksUpdateDispatch](automate::gateway::WebhooksUpdateDispatch): guild channel webhook
//! was created, update, or deleted.
//!
//! A listener function can be registered in the library by sending the name of the function to the
//! [Configuration::register](automate::Configuration::register) method using the `stateless!` macro:
//! ```
//! # use automate::{stateless, listener, Configuration, Context, Error};
//! # use automate::gateway::MessageCreateDispatch;
//! #
//! # #[listener]
//! # async fn print_hello(ctx: &Context, data: &MessageCreateDispatch) -> Result<(), Error> {
//! #     println!("Hello!");
//! #     Ok(())
//! # }
//! #
//! Configuration::from_env("DISCORD_API_TOKEN")
//!         .register(stateless!(print_hello));
//! ```
//!
//! More advanced examples can be found in the
//! [examples](https://github.com/mbenoukaiss/automate/tree/master/examples) folder.
//! If you want to keep data between calls, you probably want to use a stateful listener.
//!
//! It is possible to use `Ì€lazy_static!` to store data across calls but this is **probably not what
//! you want** since data in the `lazy_static` will be shared between shards and kept across
//! sessions.
//!
//! ## Stateful listeners
//! Stateless listeners provide a clean and quick way to setup a listener, but as stated earlier,
//! they do not allow keeping variables between two events which is necessary for a more
//! advanced bot.
//!
//! States will not be the same across shards and they will be destroyed and recreated in the case
//! of a disconnection that could not resume and results in the creation of a new Discord session.
//!
//! Stateful listeners work in the exact same way as stateless listeners except they're
//! declared in an impl block of a struct that derives the [State](automate::events::State) trait.
//! Structs containing stateful listeners must do 3 things:
//! - Derive the [State](automate::events::State) trait which can be done automatically using
//! the `#[derive(State)]` derive macro.
//! - Implement [Clone](std::clone::Clone) since they need to be cloned to be used between
//! different shards and sessions.
//! - Implement the [Initializable](automate::events::Initializable) trait which defines a
//! single function that should return all the listeners of the struct. This can be done using
//! the `methods!` macro which takes the name of the struct followed by a colon
//! and a comma-separated list of the listener methods.
//! 
//! ```
//! #[macro_use] extern crate automate;
//!
//! use automate::{Context, Error, Snowflake};
//! use automate::events::{Initializable, StatefulListener};
//! use automate::gateway::MessageCreateDispatch;
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//!
//! #[derive(State, Default, Clone)]
//! struct MessageCounter {
//!     messages: i32,
//! }
//! 
//! impl Initializable for MessageCounter {
//!     fn initialize() -> Vec<StatefulListener<Self>> {
//!         methods!(MessageCounter: count)
//!     }
//! }
//! 
//! impl MessageCounter {
//!     #[listener]
//!     async fn count(&mut self, _: &Context, data: &MessageCreateDispatch) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!         self.messages += 1;
//!         println!("A total of {} messages have been sent!", self.messages);
//!
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A state struct can be registered in the library by sending an instance of the struct to the
//! [Configuration::register](automate::Configuration::register) method using the `stateful!` macro.
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate automate;
//! #
//! # use automate::{methods, stateful, Context, Error, Snowflake, Configuration};
//! # use automate::events::{Initializable, StatefulListener};
//! # use automate::gateway::MessageCreateDispatch;
//! # use std::collections::HashMap;
//! #
//! # #[derive(State, Default, Clone)]
//! # struct MessageCounter;
//! #
//! # impl Initializable for MessageCounter {
//! #     fn initialize() -> Vec<StatefulListener<Self>> {
//! #         methods!(MessageCounter)
//! #     }
//! # }
//! #
//! Configuration::from_env("DISCORD_API_TOKEN")
//!         .register(stateful!(MessageCounter::default()));
//! ```
//!
//! More advanced examples can be found in the  Ì€examples/counter.rs` example file.
//!
//! # Storage API
//! When receiving events, you will usually need more data than the event sends you. For
//! example, you may need to know what the role of the user who sent a message is. This data
//! can be fetched through the storages using the [Context::storage](automate::Context::storage)
//! and [Context::storage_mut](automate::Context::storage_mut) to fetch mutable data.
//!
//! That can be achieved by fetching the data from Discord API each time you need it, but you will
//! quickly get rate limited. That is why the storage API caches some of the data discord sends.
//!
//! ## Caching storages
//! Automate creates 3 storages which you can **not** mutate, they only get mutated
//! through gateway events:
//! - [Guilds](automate::gateway::Guild)
//! - [Channels](automate::gateway::Channel)
//! - [Users](automate::gateway::User)
//!
//! ```
//! # use automate::listener;
//! use automate::{Context, Error};
//! use automate::gateway::{MessageCreateDispatch, User, Guild};
//!
//! #[listener]
//! async fn greet_multiple_roles(ctx: &Context, data: &MessageCreateDispatch) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     if let Some(guild) = data.0.guild_id {
//!         let storage = ctx.storage::<Guild>().await;
//!         let guild = storage.get(guild);
//!         let member = guild.members.get(&data.0.author.id).unwrap();
//!
//!         //print hello if the user has at least 2 roles
//!         if member.roles.len() >= 2 {
//!             println!("Hello!");
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Custom storages
//! You can also create your own storages. Having your own custom storages will usually allow you
//! to store data without using stateful listeners and in a simpler way.
//!
//! In order to do that, you will need to create two structs
//! one being the stored struct which should implement [Stored](automate::storage::Stored) and
//! a storage struct which should keep the stored values in memory and provide ways to retrieve
//! and inserts objects. The storage struct should implement [Storage](automate::storage::Storage).
//!
//! See [examples/levels.rs](https://github.com/mbenoukaiss/automate/blob/master/examples/levels.rs)
//! for a detailed example.
//!
//! ## Deactivating storages
//! The storages API is by default enabled but you might not want it because you simply
//! do not need to cache the data sent by discord or because you do not have a lot of RAM
//! available to run the bot. In that case, you can disable the feature by setting the
//! `default-features` key to `false` for `automate` in your `Cargo.toml` file.
//!
//! # Sharding
//! Automate implements support for sharding through the [ShardManager](automate::ShardManager)
//! struct. However, you will not need to use the [ShardManager](automate::ShardManager) directly
//! in most cases since [Automate::launch](automate::Automate::launch) will automatically
//! create as many shards as Discord recommends.
//!
//! The reasons you would need to use the [ShardManager](automate::ShardManager) are if you want
//! to spread your bot across multiple servers or if you want to launch more or less
//! shards than what Discord recommends.
//!
//! # Models
//! All the data sent by discord is deserialized into [model structs and enums](automate::gateway::models).
//!
//! The data returned by discord can be of 4 kinds:
//! - Always present
//! - Nullable: Field will be included but the data can either be null or present.
//! - Optional: Field will either not be included at all or present
//! - Optional and nullable: The field can be present, null or not included.
//!
//! Both nullable and optional are handled with  [Option](std::option::Option) enum, but optional
//! nullable are wrapped in a double [Option](std::option::Option)s because in some cases you may
//! need to know whether the data was not present, null or both.
//!
//! For example, when editing a guild member, if you need to modify some fields but NOT the
//! nickname (which is optional and nullable), you will set the `nick` field to `None`.
//! But if you want to remove the nick, it needs to be set to null and you can achieve that
//! by sending `Some(None)`.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```no_run
//! use automate::{listener, stateless, Error, Context, Configuration, Automate};
//! use automate::gateway::MessageCreateDispatch;
//! use automate::http::CreateMessage;
//!
//! #[listener]
//! async fn say_hello(ctx: &Context, data: &MessageCreateDispatch) -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     let message = &data.0;
//! 
//!     if message.author.id != ctx.bot.id {
//!         let content = Some(format!("Hello {}!", message.author.username));
//! 
//!         ctx.create_message(message.channel_id, CreateMessage {
//!             content,
//!             ..Default::default()
//!         }).await?;
//!     }
//! 
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! 
//! let config = Configuration::from_env("DISCORD_API_TOKEN")
//!     .register(stateless!(say_hello));
//!
//! Automate::launch(config);
//! ```
